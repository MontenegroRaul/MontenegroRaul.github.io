## My Favorite CPSC 120L labs

* Lab 3 part 1

    This lab was really interesting to me as it was really the first lab I encountered quite a bit of bugs on. 
    To get the calculator to work because we kept messing up the syntax for the math formula. Figuring out the 
    proper syntax and even the proper print out message was nice, and helped me understand the importance of 
    syntax so much more.

* Lab 5

    For this lab it was also an immense amount of trouble shooting as trying to use static_cast to convert class 
    types was incredibly confusing, along with struggling on how to get certain variables to work properly in the 
    if statements. Once that was understood, matching data types and converting them was so much easier, allowing 
    it to get done pretty quickly after.

* Lab 8 Part 2

    This was my favorite lab as I loved how weâ€™re trying to figure out the pattern using loops. Like using a variable 
    declared outside of the loop to help fix the problem with counting i with loops inside of the loop. Though I 
    did like figuring out using loops within loops, it was a very fun lab.
